<h1>That Good Night<a class="headerlink" href="#that-good-night" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>What part of the brain does consciousness stem from? What comes after the final breath? Is there a floating-in-space sensation? If there isn’t
one, what does ‘no sensation’ feel like? These are some of the questions many people think about. I did too. I started by searching for broad keywords
on the internet, hoping to find some thought-provoking articles. That was a mistake. After spending hours scouring the internet, I came to
hate metaphors, similes, and analogies. It seemed to me that the internet was teeming with wizened old birds who couldn’t help but quip ‘Life is like
a…’. I gave up on random webpages after that and instead went for the quotes. That was my second mistake. I hoped to find some ‘woke’ comments
and quotes that would hit home and leave me in awe of the writer. There were indeed some very brilliant and hard-hitting ones. The trouble was,
to get to them, I first had to go through a therapy session for suicide prevention, rummaging through the rest of the quotes. I left my active pursuit of
enlightenment that day.</p>
<p>Over the years, it was books that continued to
supply me with food for thought. Some theories I
read appealed to me. However, to this day, no book
has influenced my perspective as much as one by
Stephen King. A particular novel involved a man
who has been pronounced dead medically, but he
wakes up to find himself locked inside his body.
The thought wouldn’t exactly have been blood-
curdling if he was not scheduled to undergo an
autopsy.</p>
<p>I was almost ready to forget about it when I read
about ‘anaesthesia awareness’. I initially thought
of it as a docile and tame concept about bringing
the advancement in medical science to the ignorant. Its true meaning, however, caught my
imagination and shook me to the core - imagine
waking up during an operation. You have been
cut open. You feel every one of the incisions that
the surgeon makes in your body, the searing
pain as the scalpel tears at your flesh. The catch
is that you are unable to scream and have to bear
the ordeal for as long as the operation lasts or
until someone notices your eyeballs moving.</p>
<p>The fact that reality wasn’t so far from the concept
of a horror story convinced me to alter my non-
existent will to say that I wish to be buried and
not cremated. In case I meet a violent ending,
there’ll be no autopsies for me. If someone does
go ahead with an autopsy, let them be charged
with murder.</p>
<p>Many religions propound the existence of an
afterlife wherein all your mistakes and good
deeds are accounted for and your fate decided. It
is, according to me, a more interesting prospect
than floating around, formless. There are times
when I choose to believe the former and there are
those when the latter appears more plausible.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong here, but in this dilemma,
I feel jealous of those who are about to make a
peaceful getaway from the world as we know it.</p>
<p>I like to think of it in this way: The very next
moment after they exhale for the last time, the
truth or hollowness of religion and science is laid
bare before them. If they are able to retain the
feeling of consciousness, they can conclusively
know that religion had been right all along. If
there’s no such consciousness, science gets to
have the last laugh. In either case, they finally
know.</p>
<p>People have always feared death. They went
so far as to personify it to get some grip on a
mystery that eluded their mortal minds. I, on the
other hand, have a rather blunt opinion of death.
When you die old, you have seen all that life had
in store for you.</p>
<p>When you have an untimely death, there’s
always some suffering or violence preceding the
demise. If by some miracle you do survive the
ordeal, chances are, you’ll be scarred for life and
perhaps, be plagued by PTSD. So death always</p>
<p>comes as a welcome release from the misery.
Dependants, especially children, are loose ends
in my philosophy. There’s no silver lining to
the emotional trauma that children go through
when they lose one of their parents at a tender
age. That is a thing that should bother you if
you’re about to die but, (if I allow the selfish and
callous part of myself to make an observation)
the pile of dirt you are about to become won’t
give a damn.</p>
<p>I would not be so bold as to say that I look
forward to death. On the other hand, I wouldn’t
embrace immortality either. It is a dreadful and
pointless idea. Perhaps we wouldn’t have the
kind of society we have today if we knew that
we had to be around forever. Who would value
you if they knew you’re going to stick around
for eternity? Society would be frayed. Perhaps
death does play an essential role in our society.
But it doesn’t have to be feared. It would do if
only all of us realize and come to terms with the
reality that everything is transient.</p>
<p>As for me, I am dying to know if there is
something in store for us after we die. When
my time comes, and no earlier, I might even be
excited to close my eyes one final time.</p>
