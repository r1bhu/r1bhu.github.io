<h1>Disruption Tube<a class="headerlink" href="#disruption-tube" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>Admit it. There were times when you clocked
hours in the classroom, made notes, pestered
teachers and classmates with your doubts and
still failed to grasp a concept. The big musty
books could have helped you out but they seemed
uninviting to you, perhaps, because there was an
exam just around the corner and you were hard-
pressed by other subjects. If you had already taken
the pains to go through them, then it was an even
scarier situation for you because, most probably,
the prescribed textbooks were your last resort and
you just exhausted it. A crisis was unfolding before
your eyes and you could only watch helplessly,
clarity still eluding you.</p>
<p>This is indeed a nightmarish situation for anybody
who has gone through it. It would not have bothered
someone so much had they not studied diligently
and cut corners. They would still have the option
of conveniently concluding in their minds that
Had I bothered to study, had I put my mind to it, I
would have had a firm grip on the topics. They find
this thought comforting because it allows them to
hold on to their irrational belief that their mental
faculties are not in any way below par. The belief by
itself, however, is no remedy to the dire situation.
I have seen such circumstances up close when
I used to get stuck on things that my peer group
found plain sailing, too obvious to put in words. It
is in those times that I found myself a saviour in
Youtube.</p>
<p>Youtube is more than a source of entertainment. It
is more than channels running smear campaigns
against rivals (you know the one I speak of). It is a
golden-egg-laying goose that can’t be killed when
it comes to its role as a platform for dissemination
of knowledge and information. You can be sure
to find videos on everything under the sun: from
asteroid-mining to scatology.</p>
<p>The inability to visualize is most easily cured on
Youtube. With the power of computer simulations
and animation at the content creator’s disposal,
the most counterintuitive topics are explained in
an engaging way that lays to rest most, if not all,
of the doubts. This certainly gives this mode of
learning an edge over the traditional ones where
you have to depend on the lecturer’s or the
author’s power of expression to get an intuitive
feel of what is being discussed. Words alone
may or may not conjure up the right notion in
your mind but when aided by visual effects, they
certainly would.</p>
<p>Content on Youtube comes from innumerable
sources. The diversity lends different
perspectives to the outlook of the viewer about
the same topic, which could either decipher the
complex multidimensionality that most topics
and issues have for the person or befuddle him/
her. Then there is always the question of the
veracity of the content. While there is no sure-
shot way out of this problem (short of seeking
the opinion of a stalwart in that field) one could
almost always rely on statistics that Youtube so
graciously provides: the number of subscribers
(for a channel) and likes and views (for any
video in general). This may sound like adopting
herd mentality, but it does pay off most of the
times - if a large number of people from different
backgrounds find a video’s content useful, the
balance of probability says you too would find
the content enriching.</p>
<p>Another significant advantage of using Youtube
for scholarly pursuits is that reputed institutions
often make podcasts of their lectures and make
them available there. Gone are the days where you
could moan about the incompetence of teachers
in your institute and shirk off responsibility
towards your academics. Now with content
from across the world a click away, you can get
introduced to a subject by the experts. You too
would swear by the laws of Physics once you
see Walter Lewin swinging on a pendulum and
putting his life on the line to convince you.</p>
<p>Recreational learning is having its day under the
sun since Youtube became a breeding ground
for channels that seek to demystify complex-
looking, interesting topics like cosmology and
applied mathematics that most would shy away</p>
<p>from. Captivating graphics and lucid explanations
compel you to binge-watch the entire series,
leaving you hungry for more. Once you get started,
you’ll realize you are on auto-pilot, reading up
things from the videos that piqued your curiosity.
By the end of it, you’re left with hundreds of tabs
on your window and enough knowledge under
your belt to come across as learned.</p>
<p>Youtube has ensured that learning need not be
devoid of amusement. If you ever feel the need to
take a break, you only need to scroll down. All of
a person’s wit condensed into a few lines is what
makes up a large part of the comments section.
However witty you think you might be, you’ll
find plenty of comments that will bowl you over
with their sheer brilliance. It is a wonder Youtube
doesn’t charge us for viewing the comments
section! Under a video explaining the geometry
of higher dimensions, a particularly learned man
writes: “I have a way of visualizing spheres of
dimensions n &gt; 3… It’s just that it isn’t legal in most
states…”.</p>
<p>For all its virtues, Youtube is yet to replace
conventional teaching modes. While one may feel
they have understood something entirely from
a single or even a series of Youtube videos, in
reality, they have barely scratched the surface. It is
common knowledge that most videos on scientific
topics leave out the complicated maths (which is
integral to understanding the subject completely)
in favour of garnering the attention of the masses
and increasing views. Thus the content is rarely
exhaustive and should be used to complement the
traditional learning resources. Used effectively
in conjunction with books, you would soon be
rewarded with your ‘Aha!’ moment when you
finally make sense of the things you had been
struggling with previously.</p>
